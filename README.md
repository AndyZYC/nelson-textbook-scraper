# Nelson Online Student Textbook Scraper

Scrapes Nelson Student Textbooks into PDFs because their web interface is horrible

## Usage

**Nelson Textbook Code(s) Needed** as their PDFs cannot be accessed without first obtaining a code

1. Log in through Nelson's website to access their [dashboard](https://www.mynelson.com/mynelson/staticcontent/html/PublicLogin.html)
2. Open your textbook of choice and open any PDF within it
3. Open your web browser's console
   * `Ctrl + Shift + i` for Google Chrome
4. Paste everything from [src.min.js](https://github.com/chen7944/nelson-textbook-scraper/blob/master/src.min.js) into the console and hit **enter**
5. The script will prompt you for configuration
6. The pdf version of all the chapters will be downloaded to your web browser's download directory
7. If you wish to merge the PDFs, here are some I found (I don't advocate for any of them):
